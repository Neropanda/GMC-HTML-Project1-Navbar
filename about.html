        <h2>My Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <article>
            Glad I reeled you in to read more about me (now you're gonna say 'well of course who wouldn't want that) 
            <br>
            My main hobbies are Gaming, Reading, & Writing, everything also usually 
            would fall as a subcategory of one of these.
            <br>
            But For Interests, I am deeply interested in:

                <li>Neurology & Neurospychology</li>
