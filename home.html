        <h1>Now We're Ready To Talk, Here's a little about me</h1>
        <article>I started my Software Dev journey years ago as a hobby since I thought I was "proficient with computers"
            which I am, but knowing a couple gimmicks <i>shockingly</i> didn't really translate to programming an entire website or software from scratch,
            still, I persisted of course, I kept learning more and more about Web Development from various free sources up until my univeristy year as a
            Marketing student started and my youtube went from gaming videos and rants to a bunch of coding-terms-that-cannot-be-English, but this year I decided
            to fully commit to a career as a Software Developper, a seed I plan to passionately water through putting smiles on the faces of clients such 
            as you sir, or lady, or...yes. 
            <br>
            <strong>PS-</strong> Yes I do understand those coding terms now, most at least.
